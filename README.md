Proposed Data Analysis Approach

Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handle Missing Values: Employ appropriate imputation techniques (e.g., mean, median, mode) or deletion based on data context and significance.
Data Formatting: Ensure consistency in date and time formats, and standardize text data (e.g., uppercase, lowercase).
Outlier Detection and Handling: Identify and address outliers through statistical methods (e.g., Z-score, IQR) or domain knowledge.
Data Type Conversion: Convert data types as necessary (e.g., string to numeric, date to datetime).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate Analysis:
Numerical Variables: Compute summary statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation, quartiles), visualize distributions using histograms, box plots, and kernel density plots.
Categorical Variables: Calculate frequency distributions, visualize using bar charts and pie charts.
Bivariate Analysis:
Numerical-Numerical: Analyze correlations using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
Numerical-Categorical: Compare distributions across categories using box plots and bar charts.
Categorical-Categorical: Analyze relationships using cross-tabulations and chi-square tests.

Time Series Analysis
Time Series Decomposition: Decompose the call volume time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
Trend Analysis: Identify long-term trends using techniques like linear regression or moving averages.
Seasonality Analysis: Analyze seasonal patterns using Fourier analysis or statistical methods.
Forecasting: Employ time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, exponential smoothing) to predict future call volumes.
Manpower Planning and Optimization
Agent Performance Analysis: Evaluate individual agent performance metrics (e.g., average handle time, average call duration, call volume) to identify strengths and weaknesses.
Shift Scheduling Optimization: Utilize historical data and forecasting models to optimize shift schedules and staffing levels, aiming to balance workload and minimize costs.
Queue Management: Analyze queue metrics (e.g., average wait time, abandonment rate) to identify bottlenecks and implement strategies to improve customer experience.

Data Visualization and Reporting
Data Visualization Tools: Employ tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn) to create insightful visualizations.
Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive dashboards to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) and track performance over time.
Report Generation: Create comprehensive reports summarizing findings, insights, and recommendations.
By following this structured approach, we can derive actionable insights to optimize manpower allocation, enhance customer experience, and improve overall operational efficiency.
